    <p class="main-text"> With so many hotels to choose from, booking your stay can become overwhelming. However, the easiest way to approach this situation is to think of your price range. Here are some of our suggestions that cover all budgets. </p>
    <ul class="main-ul">
      <li>
        <p>1. Join a Rewards program. This is almost a must for a stay in Las Vegas. For example, for a stay at any MGM property, join MGM Rewards. Download their app and register an email address with them and that INSTANTLY gets you 25% off your room rate without spending a dime.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> 2. Speaking of Rewards programs, once you check in one of the first things you should do is go downstairs and get a rewards CARD. These cards are linked throughout hotel ecosystems. For example, if you are in a bar at the Aria, but are staying at Park MGM, you can charge your drink to your room using your rewards card since both hotels are owned by MGM. This is a great way to avoid having to carry cash around. It's also preferred that you
          spend your money in a way that allows the resort to track your spending. Whether you're gambling, eating, or drinking, you want them to know you're spending. This could lead to comps for future visits.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> 3. The 20 dollar trick! This one is a bit more fun but the results vary. While most resorts these days have mobile check-in, if you're old fashioned you can still go up to the counters in the lobby. Once there, you usually have to provide an ID and a credit card. Some guests will try to slip a 20 dollar bill to the hotel employee between those 2 cards and somehow ask if there are any upgrades available. This one requires a bit more research online for the nuance that goes into it. But someone who booked a basic room might find themselves with an upgrade to a room with a Strip view, etc. And ultimately, if they aren't able to help you out at the front desk, they won't be keeping your money. So no harm, no foul. Best of luck!</p>
