    <p class="main-text"> With so many hotels to choose from, booking your stay can become overwhelming. However, the easiest way to approach this situation is to think of your price range. Here are some of our suggestions that cover all budgets. </p>
    <ul class="main-ul">
      <li><p>1. The Cosmopolitan. This is the best of the best. The most fun hotel experience on the Strip, but also the most expensive. Also one of the only hotels in Las Vegas with balconies. The bar scene downstairs is second to none. If you are looking to really treat yourself, Cosmo would be the best way to do so.</p></li>
      <li><p>2. Aria. This is a great second optional and considerably more affordable than The Cosmo. Great places to eat for all budgets and tastes. Definitely starting to copy Cosmo's playbook as far as making the experience hip and unique. Rooms are spacious and the beds are the comfiest on the Strip.</p></li>
      <li><p>3. Paris. This is a great "middle of the road" hotel. Very fun theme with great restaurants, but not a lot of bars. Perhaps the best thing about this location is that it is across the street from the Bellagio so if you were to get a decent room, you could look right out your window and see the world famous Bellagio fountains.</p></li>
      <li><p>4. Bellagio. The most iconic hotel in all of Las Vegas, and one of the most famous in the world. While this lands somewhere in price between The Cosmo and Aria, there's not as much going on downstairs as there used to be. It has had trouble keeping up with the hip bar scene of more modern hotels. Not many cheap eats on site either. Foodies and bar hoppers might be disappointed.</p></li>
      <li><p>5. Park MGM. Best budget hotel right on the Strip. This one doesn't feel as luxurious as some others at the top of this list, but there's plenty going on downstairs in terms of bars and places to eat. It's also steps from T-Mobile Arena and actually connected right to the Aria. So if you wanted to stay somewhere cheaper but be close to a more hip, popular place like Aria, Park MGM isn't a bad compromise at all. Rooms are ugly, but spacious. Nice bathrooms with phenomenal shower pressure.</p></li>
